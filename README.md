# webostv
 Extension of home-assistant component webostv as of v0.100.3 to add support for missing button presses.

## Temporary Solution
This acts as a 'temporary' enhancement to the webostv integration included in home assistant to add the much needed functionality for ,left, right, up, down, enter, which was sorely needed when in apps.

## Long Term Solution
Long term solution at time of release looks to be a proposed enhancement by [bendavid]([https://github.com/bendavid](https://github.com/bendavid)) to extend functionality to media_player, negating the need for the remote. See [https://github.com/TheRealLink/pylgtv/pull/19](https://github.com/TheRealLink/pylgtv/pull/19) and [https://github.com/home-assistant/architecture/issues/299#issuecomment-546714758](https://github.com/home-assistant/architecture/issues/299#issuecomment-546714758)
